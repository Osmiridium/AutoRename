**Automatically rename downloaded images from the internet**

This Chromium extension is designed to automatically rename files using custom parameters to keep your files more organized. Normally, when you download files from the internet, file names are often scrambled with random words and numbers that don't mean anything.  

**BEFORE**

Using the default "Save image as" option in Microsoft Edge.

**AFTER**

Using the extension "Save image as (AutoRename)" in Microsoft Edge.

`[@][Twitter username] [Tweet ID] [Random string].`

These parameters can be customized in the Extension Options.

## Compatibility

This extension primarily targets the Microsoft Edge (Chromium) and Google Chrome browsers only. I cannot guarantee support for other Chromium based browsers.
